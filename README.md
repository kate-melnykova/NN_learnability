Numerical experiences for investigation of the neural network performance

The neural nets become more and more popular, while they remain a black box.
Recently, numerous papers investigate theoretical performance guarantees and
drawbacks of the neural nets. For example,
**Why many NN generalize well?**
**How well shallow (2-layer) NN can approximate the given function?**
In these notebooks, I investigate some theoretical findings numerically.
